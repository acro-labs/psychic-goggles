Portable python app to sort desktop on mac

# Instructions 
Download the zip file by pressing the download button above 

1. Unzip by double clicking the downloaded file you should now see an app called sort_folder
2. Double click and your mac will present a warning that the file cannot be opened because it is not from a licensed #evilcorp developer, press cancel.
3. Now Go to your settings by clicking the apple icon in your top left corner and then "System Prefrences" and then the "Security and Privacy" icon 
4. Under "Security and Privacy" go to the "General" tab
5. You should see a message that sort_folder was blocked from running, but here you can click "Open anyway" and the program will run with the initial warning message, but now you will have the option to "open" (and from now on you can run by double clicking and you wont get a warning)
6. The app wil sort you desktop files into respective folders based on file endings jpg's goes into the jpg_folder, docx in the docx_folder etc
7. For easy access in the future I recommend dragging the app from downloads to your aplications folder 

That it enojoy desktop zen!
